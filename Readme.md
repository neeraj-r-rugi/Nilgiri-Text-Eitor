## Technical Details

### Built With
- **GTK+ 3.0**: Cross-platform GUI toolkit
- **GtkSourceView 3.0**: Text editing widget with syntax highlighting
- **C Programming Language**: Core implementation

### Architecture
The editor is structured with modular components:
- `main.c`: Application entry point and UI initialization
- `file_handling.c`: File I/O operations
- `fonts.c`: Font and zoom management
- `process.c`: Keyboard event handling
- `menu_bar.c`: Menu system implementation
- `overlays.c`: UI overlay management

### System Requirements
- GTK+ 3.0 or higher
- GtkSourceView 3.0 or higher
- GCC compiler (or compatible)

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Development Notes

- The editor uses GTK's native file dialogs and widgets
- Syntax highlighting is automatically detected based on file extension
- The application follows GTK+ design patterns and conventions
- CSS styling is loaded dynamically for theme support
- ❗ Note: The editor does not prompt to save on close via the window button — this is by design, inspired by minimalist tools like Vim. Use Ctrl + S or menu options to save manually. Closing using Ctrl + Esc does prompt to save before closing.

## Known Limitations

- Hard close (window X button) doesn't check for unsaved changes
- Windows compilation requires manual Makefile updates
- Theme toggle may not work if system is set to dark mode
